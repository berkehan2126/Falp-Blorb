Flapy Blorb 🐦
Flapy Blorb is a simple clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, created as a learning project to improve my skills in game development using Unity. The main goal of this project is to understand game mechanics, physics, and player interactions.

📌 Project Overview
Purpose: This game was developed as a part of my journey to learn Unity and C#.
Status: The game is completed for basic functionality, but I may add more features in the future.
Objective: The player controls a bird-like character (Blorb) and tries to navigate through pipes without crashing.

🚀 Gameplay
Mechanics:
Tap or click to make the bird jump.
Avoid obstacles and aim for a high score.
Features:
Endless scrolling gameplay.
Score tracking system.
Simple physics-based movement.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Unity Engine
C# Programming Language

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Understanding Unity’s 2D physics system.
Implementing player input for smooth controls.
Managing obstacles and creating an endless game loop.
Tracking scores and resetting game states.

🙌 Future Improvements
Add sound effects and animations.
Introduce difficulty progression as the game continues.
Create a main menu and game-over screen for a polished experience.
